    "PyRN is a library of reaction networks that allows not only to obtain properties of reaction networks, but also to study their evolution. It was created for the purpose of studying the goal-directedness of reaction networks. \n",

    "This documents will show the use of this library. For this purpose, it is divided into several subdocuments, each of which describes a functional part of the library:\n",
