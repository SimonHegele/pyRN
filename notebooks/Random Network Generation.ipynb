    "This module (RNIRG) of the pyRN library, allows to generate random networks. This module consists of several functions that allow to generate or modify networks with different properties. In this section we will explain the use of the functions to generate random networks, however to understand more in depth how the parameters affect the stability of the network, it may be interesting to read the following document:\n",
