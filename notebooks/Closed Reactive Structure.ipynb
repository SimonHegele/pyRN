    "In the literature there already exist algorithms that search for the organizations of a reaction network [Florian et al (2008)](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btn228). To reduce the number of combination elements and therfore the time to compute the organizations, this library takes an alternative path, where the elements to be combined do not correspond to species, instead elements of a equivalance class, called generators. A generator corresponds to a set of reactions, in which the support of each reaction generates the same closed set, by means of the generated closure. Considering the latter these sets are defined by an equivalence relation:\n",

Then it is verified if each of these union-closure corresponds to a synergy and if the resulting set is semi-self-maintained or an organization. Then this operation is repeated recursively with the generated sets, until all the reactive closures are obtained.
